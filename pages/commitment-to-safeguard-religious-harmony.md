Singapore has enjoyed a high level of harmony and peace in our religiously diverse society. This is not by accident, and we must constantly work to protect, cherish and promote our religious harmony, as it is key to our peace, prosperity and progress. To this end, we reaffirm the following:
 
#### Upholding Freedom of Religion
We will uphold the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion, and the right of every person to profess, practise, and propagate beliefs different from our own, including not having religious beliefs. 
 
#### Building Stronger Bonds
Strong bonds across faiths are key to religious harmony. While our faiths may be different, we share common values, such as charity, love, respect and empathy. It is consistent with our values to encourage regular interaction, including the following:
* Building and maintaining meaningful relationships with others of a different faith;
* Offering help to others of a different faith, including in times of crisis;
* Offering non-religious commercial services to all regardless of faith, and procuring the same from establishments where owners may have displayed symbols of their faith;
* Allowing each other space to profess our faiths, and to do so in a respectful and sensitive manner;
* Eating together with others, even if we have different religious dietary requirements and practices;
* Expressing good wishes for and attending each other’s festival celebrations; and
* Attending the life events of others of a different faith, such as weddings and funerals, even if these are held in the place of worship of that faith.
 
#### Fostering a Culture of Consideration and Mutual Understanding

We will foster a culture of consideration and mutual understanding. When interacting with people of other beliefs, we will uphold social norms of compromise and accommodation. We recognise that while our society is multi-religious, the State is secular, and that in the common spaces, the expression of one’s faith may give rise to misunderstandings. We accept that not all persons will be aware of religious sensitivities, and when misunderstandings or disputes arise, we will resolve them through respectful dialogue.
 
#### Sharing and Propagating Beliefs Respectfully and Sensitively

We will share and propagate our beliefs respectfully, paying attention to inter-faith and intra-faith sensitivities. We will ensure that our practices are also done in a respectful and sensitive manner. We will not denigrate or insult other faiths, or promote ill-will. We reject unequivocally and will never tolerate any form of violence against anyone, including violence inflicted because of a person’s faith. 
 
#### Maintaining Solidarity in Crisis

In times of crisis, we will express solidarity with each other, consult one another, help one another, and work together towards maintaining social cohesion as our overriding goal.
 
#### Supporting Institutional Efforts

We will support national institutions that aim to uphold and promote religious harmony, such as the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle, National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony, and the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. We will work towards organising and participating in activities for all to build friendship and trust, and jointly work on projects for the common good.
 
#### Safeguarding Religious Harmony for a Better Singapore for All

We embrace and will practise the affirmations in this Commitment. Through our words and actions, we can contribute to religious harmony in Singapore. Together, we ensure that our nation continues to progress and prosper in peace and harmony, and enable all to lead fulfilling lives in accordance with their beliefs.

### About the Commitment

Singapore’s religious leaders have come together to affirm our shared commitment to safeguard religious harmony. This is a stand against division and discord between religious communities. While we are of different faiths and beliefs, we are united in promoting the common good. We see difference not as separation, but as contribution – diverse gifts we bring to the future that we all share.    
 
We invite all religious organisations in Singapore to take a stand with us.

### Frequently Asked Questions about the Commitment

1.	What is the Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony?

The Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony articulates the shared values to safeguard our religious harmony, as well as many positive ways Singaporeans have been interacting across religions to foster a cohesive society.

With global trends and practices dividing communities along religious lines, religious leaders representing various faiths in Singapore have agreed that it is important to continually reaffirm their commitment to shared values that undergird religious harmony. The Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony was then developed following several discussions among local religious leaders, with support from the Government. The full text of the Commitment can be found at www.ircc.sg/commitment.

2.	How is the Commitment different from previous declarations or guidelines for Religious Harmony?

The Commitment elaborates on the 2003 Declaration on Religious Harmony, which outlines the broad principles for inter-religious confidence. The 2003 Declaration is currently recited at inter-faith events such as Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society’s annual Inter Racial Inter Religious Harmony Nite, and the annual IRO Day organised by the Inter-Religious Organisation (“IRO”).

The Commitment goes beyond past declarations on religious harmony by emphasising the many positive ways Singaporeans have been interacting across religions, that will allow us to continue to enjoy a highly cohesive society, and prevent segregationist or exclusivist practices from taking root and separating communities. The 2003 Declaration on Religious Harmony can be found at https://iro.sg/about/declaration/.
