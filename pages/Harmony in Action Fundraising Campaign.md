<p><strong>What will the donation be allocated for?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The donation will be used for delivering essential relief aid which includes
food, health, sanitation, medical supplies and education. The funds raised
may be used (and not limited to) for procurement of vital supplies such
as food, water, medical aid and sanitation for the affected communities
in Gaza.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>How does RLAF ensure the funds and essential aid reach the children and their families in Gaza?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>RLAF works closely with trusted international partners, including the
Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization (JHCO), Humanity Matters (HM), and
the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), to ensure that the funds and
essential aid reach the affected communities in Gaza. Their partners on
the ground provide regular updates, including detailed reports and photographs,
to verify that the aid is being distributed effectively. Through these
partnerships, RLAF is able to monitor the impact of the support and ensure
that the aid reaches the children and families who need it most.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>How does RLAF ensure the donations are properly collected and audited?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this fundraising appeal, RLAF follows a meticulous process to ensure
transparency and accountability with the donations received:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We firstly obtained the necessary permit from the Commissioner of Charities
to raise the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon approval, RLAF will commence the fundraising campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All monetary donations would then be carefully consolidated and recorded
after the campaign period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RLAF would then commission an external auditor to certify the donations
for the campaign to ensure all transactions are accurately and properly
recorded. And the report would be sent to the Commissioner of Charities
(CoC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the audit, RLAF would remit the funds to all their beneficiaries
based on the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The beneficiaries will then provide us with a comprehensive written report
detailing the utilisation of the funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RLAF would also conduct monitoring visits for due diligence to assess
the impact of our relief efforts and ensure the funds are utilised accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the donations are collected through approved crowdfunding platforms,
including <a href="https://rlafoundation.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Giving.sg</a> and
RLAF’s own direct donation platform. Both platforms are designed with robust
security measures to ensure the safety and protection of your contributions.
