**1. What are the Racial and Religious Harmony Circles (Harmony Circle)?**

The Racial and Religious Harmony Circles – better known as Harmony Circle  – are local-level interfaith platforms in every constituency, formed to promote racial and religious harmony.

**2. When was the Harmony Circle formed? Who are the members of Harmony Circles?**

Members of Harmony Circles comprise leaders from religious and ethnic-based organisations, as well as community organisations located within each constituency. Harmony Circles in the various constituencies adhere to the same mission – to build close ties between people regardless of their race or religion.
 
**3. What do Harmony Circles do?**

The Harmony Circles serve as important bridges between religious, ethnic and community groups at the local grassroots level. Leaders from these diverse groups come together to form the Harmony Circle network to build friendship and trust among each other.

The Harmony Circles also aim to deepen people's understanding of the various faiths, beliefs and practices through inter-faith and inter-ethnic themed activities such as heritage trails, inter-faith talks and various ethnic and religious celebrations.

In addition, the Harmony Circles are trained to respond quickly to racial and religious tensions. Harmony Circles will be the key links to disseminate timely and accurate information and to maintain confidence in the community.

**4. What are some of Harmony Circle’s programmes?**

Interfaith Dialogues – Dialogue enhances understanding and appreciation of the different faiths and beliefs though sharing of knowledge and perspectives from religious leaders and representatives.

Interfaith Visits – Guided visits to places of worship allow for greater insights into the various faiths and their religious practices. Participants will be able to better appreciate Singapore’s rich heritage and religious diversity through first hand experience and in-depth explanations from religious leaders and representatives.

IRCC Cares – Launched in 2009, "IRCC Cares" aims to help the less privileged in the community through a series of fund-raising and/or charity projects. The programme allows community leaders, religious organisations and partners to connect with one another, forge relationships and play their part for the less fortunate. It is a good example of the Harmony Circle’s commitment in constantly exploring new ways of interaction and communication. 

Capability-building Programmes – Courses, workshops and crisis-preparedness exercises are conducted to equip members with the skills and knowledge to facilitate their work in promoting inter-faith and inter-racial harmony and overcome challenges in maintaining peace in the community.
