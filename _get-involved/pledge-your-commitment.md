### Community Support for the Commitment

All segments of society – not just religious organisations – have stepped forward to express support to safeguard religious harmony in Singapore. These include workplaces, educational institutions, and social, civic and community organisations. 

This shows that Singapore society is united on the importance of safeguarding religious harmony, and the values and behaviours we expect from ourselves and others, as expressed in the Commitment. With unity as a foundation, the more diverse we are, the richer the possibilities of what we can build together for Singapore.

### Pledge your Commitment

We invite all religious organisations in Singapore to affirm their commitment to safeguarding religious harmony in Singapore by completing the sign up form and submit to  commitment@ircc.sg. 

Not a religious organisation but wish to support the Commitment? Write in to commitment@ircc.sg to share a message of support!
