### Frequently Asked Questions about the Commitment

**1.	What is the Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony?**

The Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony articulates the shared values to safeguard our religious harmony, as well as many positive ways Singaporeans have been interacting across religions to foster a cohesive society.

With global trends and practices dividing communities along religious lines, religious leaders representing various faiths in Singapore have agreed that it is important to continually reaffirm their commitment to shared values that undergird religious harmony. The Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony was then developed following several discussions among local religious leaders, with support from the Government.

**2.	How is the Commitment different from previous declarations or guidelines for Religious Harmony?**

The Commitment elaborates on the 2003 Declaration on Religious Harmony, which outlines the broad principles for inter-religious confidence. The 2003 Declaration is currently recited at inter-faith events such as Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society’s annual Inter Racial Inter Religious Harmony Nite, and the annual IRO Day organised by the Inter-Religious Organisation (“IRO”).

The Commitment goes beyond past declarations on religious harmony by emphasising the many positive ways Singaporeans have been interacting across religions, that will allow us to continue to enjoy a highly cohesive society, and prevent segregationist or exclusivist practices from taking root and separating communities. The 2003 Declaration on Religious Harmony can be found at [https://iro.sg/](https://iro.sg/).
