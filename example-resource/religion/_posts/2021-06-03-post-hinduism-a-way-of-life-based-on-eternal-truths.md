Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world, but it may be more accurate to call it a way of life. 
 
Unlike other religions, Hinduism does not have a specific founder. Neither did it originate from a particular period of human history. Rather, it is a combination of philosophies, beliefs and practices that are recorded in ancient scriptures called the Vedas, meaning “knowledge”. 
 
The scribes who penned the Vedas are said to have been simply recording truths that had always existed. These truths were conceived through meditative means and came to be known as shruti, commonly understood as “that which was heard”. They were passed down from master to student orally for generations, with great care to keep the content intact.
 
### Key Tenets of Hinduism
 
While Hinduism draws from many sources, the central focus of its practice is to free oneself from cycles of reincarnation by achieving enlightenment.
 
This is only possible when the soul is at one with Brahman, which is the absolute reality and the source of all things. 
 
In Hinduism, the purpose of life is to recognise the essential oneness of existence. This, however, is often clouded by the illusion of duality – the belief that one is separate from others and Brahman – often reinforced by our experiences in the physical world. 
 
To overcome the lure of duality, Hindus need to discern what is good and pursue it according to their dharma, or duty. The action involved in this pursuit is their karma. The more dutifully they perform their karma in accordance with their dharma, the closer they get to attaining enlightenment.
 
### Hinduism In Practice
 
Hinduism is practised by 6.5% of the population in Singapore, according to a census conducted in 2015.
