### A Belief in the Oneness of Religion and Humanity
 
With just eight Continental Houses of Worship around the world, and a few local and national Houses of Worship currently in construction in various countries, the Baha’i Faith may not be familiar to most people. After all, the religion is only around 200 years old.
 
The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet Founder of the Faith, provides a compelling vision and means for the creation of a united and just world that embraces the diversity of the human race.

Baha’is believe in collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds  be they friends, family, neighbours, or co-workers, to put what they have learnt into action for the betterment of society.

#### Key Tenets of the Baha’i Faith
 
If there is one thing that stands out about the Baha’i Faith, it is the principle of oneness – oneness of religion and oneness of humankind.
 
**One God, One Human Family**
 
Baha’is believe that the exalted figures of all religions, from Abraham to Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Baha’u’llah, were sent by one and the same God. They were Divine Educators, or Manifestations of God, who provided divine guidance progressively for humanity’s social and spiritual advancement.
 
Key to the Baha’i Faith, too, is the conviction that everyone belongs to one human family. This mindset calls for the elimination of prejudice in any form, whether it is race-, religion-, nation- or gender-related. 
 
**Baha’u’llah, The Promised One**
 
Baha’is are of the opinion that the most recent Divine Educator, Baha’u’llah, is The Promised One of God’s divine messengers.
 
Baha’u’llah, whose name means “Glory of God”, revealed  thousands of essays, letters and books – including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book. His call is for unity is on a scale that has never been attempted before by his predecessors: God’s work for him is to bring about the unification of the entire human race.
 
Baha’u’llah likens the world of humanity to the human body, in which millions of cells, though diverse in form and function, each play a part in maintaining a healthy body system.
 
In his writings, he posits: “The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men”.
 
#### The Baha’i Faith in Practice 
 
The Baha’i community in Singapore is modest in size, numbering around 2,000 as of 2020. The bedrock of the Baha’i community life is the Nineteen Day Feast, where members gather to pray, discuss matters relating to the welfare of the community, and engage in fellowship every 19 days.
 
Baha’is are encouraged to cultivate the habit of praying in the morning and evening, and are required to recite one of the three Obligatory Prayers in private daily. In addition, a number of them also gather with family, friends and neighbours to offer prayers in devotional settings.
 
Followers of the faith spend time in private study and personal reflection on the writings of Baha’u’llah as well. The learning continues through educational programmes by the Training Institute, open to all, with the aim of gaining spiritual insights and practical skills to make a difference within their fields of influence.
 
#### Major Events
 
**Riḍván**
 
The holiest festival in the Baha’i calendar is Ridvan, which commemorates the 12 days that Baha’u’llah spent with his family and followers in Baghdad, gathered at a garden that he named Ridvan, meaning “paradise”.
 
During this time, he declared that he was the Manifestation of God, the Promised One that his predecessor, the Bab, was referring to. He also took the opportunity to share the foundational spiritual principles at the heart of his teachings with the audience.
 
On the first day of the festival, Baha’is all over the world receive and read a Ridvan message from the Universal House of Justice, the international governing council of the Baha’i Faith, and also elect their local governing councils. Conventions, gatherings and festivities continue throughout the 12-day celebration.
 
**Twin Holy Days – Birth of the Bab and Birth of Baha’u’llah**
 
The Twin Holy Days – two successive Baha’i festival marking the birthdays of the Bab and Baha’u’llah – are significant events in the Baha’i Faith. 
 
Born just a day shy of two years earlier than Baha’u’llah, the Bab, whose name means “the Gate”, was the forerunner of the former. His mission from God was to herald the arrival and open the way for the coming of Baha’u’llah.
 
The double celebration of the birthdays of the two Manifestations of God in the Baha’i Faith holds great meaning for Baha’is around the world. They mark this joyous time of the year by coming together to pray, read the writings of the faith, reflect on the purpose and implications of the appearance of the Manifestations of God in the world, and express their joy through song and dance.
